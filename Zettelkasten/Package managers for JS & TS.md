NPM, Yarn, PNPM and Bun are some major package managers for JS & TS used for managing the dependencies in JS & TS. 

- NPM has the largest ecosystem but is the slowest and has the least efficient disk usage compared to others along with high dependency conflicts. NPM is the least recommended and it can be used for smaller & beginner projects. 
- Yarn is developed by Facebook that has better speed and efficient disk usage along with monorepo support and offline features that is beneficial for Large projects with Monolithic architecture. 
- PNPM is the most recommended package manager that has the best speed and efficient disk usage with strict dependency management preventing phantom dependencies. Personally, I prefer using PNPM over any other package managers.
- Bun is an all in one tool: package manager, bundler and runtime. It has good speed and efficient disk usage just lacking behind PNPM considered to be cutting edge technology. Be cautious as Bun is not fully compatible with all Node.js APIs and packages
