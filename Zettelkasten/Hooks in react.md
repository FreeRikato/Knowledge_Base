> Hooks allow functional components to manage state and perform side effects
- [!] Before hooks, state and lifecycle methods were managed using class components but this was too verbose and complex.

They are called "Hooks" because they allow you to hook into React's state and lifecycle features from functional components

- [-] Think of hooks like adding special abilities to the functional components
- `useState` gives the component the ability to "remember"
- `useEffect` give the component the ability to interact with the outside world (side effects)
