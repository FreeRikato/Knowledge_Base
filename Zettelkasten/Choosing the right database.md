Choosing the right database is indeed a hassle since it has numerous options,
- SQLite
- MySQL
- PostegreSQL
- MongoDB

I will skip out other databases since these are primarily used for development. SQLite is more concerned with local lightweight storage, whereas both MySQL and PostgreSQL follow the RDBMS paradigm where the difference would be speed, performance and learning curve. PostgreSQL shines in performance hence used in highly intensive applications and MySQL slightly shines in reading data hence used in Medium level applications. MongoDB has a different approach where unstructured and unstructured data has to be dealt with.

To Summarize,
* SQLite => Lightweight - Embedded - Local - Prototype
* MySQL => Medium level - Balance btw performance and speed
* PostgreSQL => Highly intensive - Complex queries - Data integrity
* MongoDB => Unstructured - Prototype
