## State

- An object that represents the current state of the app
- It is the dynamic things in your app (things that change)

We write the logic to change the state based on a condition or operation and React takes the responsibility to change it on the frontend for us.

## Component - Building blocks of the application like Legos

- Takes care of How a DOM element is rendered, given a state
- Components are re-usable, dynamic and HTML snippets that changes given the state

State is the input to Component that renders the current state value and if in case there is a change in state, then the component is Re-rendered.

> So, provided with state, component and state-component connection, React takes of rendering and re-rendering the state update with DOM manipulation accordingly when state changes.
