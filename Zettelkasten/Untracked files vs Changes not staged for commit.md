This was a little hard to understand but so silly. 

Untracked files are changes that the git is not aware of, for example i create a new file example.txt and make changes inside it. The git is not aware of the newly created file example.txt nor the changes inside it.

Changes not staged for commit are the newly made changes done on top of a file that is already tracked by git and committed.
